Diffusion MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a non-invasive imaging technique that plays a crucial role in the study of the brain's microstructural organization. Unlike traditional MRI, diffusion MRI focuses on the diffusion process of water molecules in biological tissues, particularly in the neural pathways of the brain. This unique approach allows for the detailed mapping of the diffusion process of molecules, primarily water, providing insights into the cellular structure of tissues. By measuring the direction and magnitude of water molecule movement, diffusion MRI can reveal important details about tissue architecture, which is particularly useful in neural imaging.

The primary application of diffusion MRI is in the field of medical imaging, especially in understanding and diagnosing neurological disorders. It is exceptionally valuable in the early detection of stroke, where it can identify areas of the brain with restricted blood flow. Additionally, diffusion MRI is instrumental in brain research, aiding in the study of diseases like Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis, as well as in brain development research. The technique's ability to visualize and track the pathways of white matter in the brain has also made it a vital tool in pre-surgical planning for brain tumor patients, as it helps surgeons avoid critical areas of the brain during operations.
